This is my first blog.

Hello World
======

This is my first blog!

Welcome to my Personal Website!

This website is used to record my learning steps and experience towards a professional programmer (maybe major in backend or application developer). In this blog, I will show the most detailed ways of learning and development knowledges. Some code might be too long and I may put a link on GitHub for every reader to access (instead of writing directly on the blog).

In my blog, I will cover different aspects of topics, including:

-   BackEnd Development
-   Application Development
-   Machine Learning and AI
-   Software Testing
-   and so on

Thanks for visiting my blog. Hope everyone have a nice day!

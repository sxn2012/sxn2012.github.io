I am doing the master's study in the University of Melbourne. My research area is machine learning and data science, that is how machine learning can help improve traditional data structures and algorithms in the big data era.

Before beginning to study for my postgraduate course, I enjoyed four-year bachelor's study in Jiangsu, China, where I have done some projects and learnt programming skills. My final project of this course is developing a platform that can securely store and mange different version of documents, with the function of recover from old-version documents. My thesis had focused on the ways to improve the security of a system, avoiding all kings of attacks, to provide users with a safe and usable system.

As a master student of the University of Melbourne, I have been working hard in enrolled subjects as well as academic research projects.

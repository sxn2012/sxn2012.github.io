I'm doing the master's study in the University of Melbourne. Before beginning to study for my postgraduate course, I enjoyed four-year bachelor's study in Jiangsu, China, where I have done some projects and learnt programming skills. As a master student of the University of Melbourne, I have been working hard in enrolled subjects as well as academic research projects.

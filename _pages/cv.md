Projects
======

-   [MVCC Algorithms Implementation](https://github.com/sxn2012/DA2020S1_Project) (Feb - June 2020)

    Task: Simulate a database, and implement the MVCC Algorithm from scratch to ensure data consistency.

    Details:

    1.  Isolation level is Read Committed. Each transaction can only access the committed data of other transactions;
    2.  When the read operation of one transaction conflicts with write operation of another transaction, it will get the previous version of data and another transaction will fail and rollback automatically.

    Results: It can ensure data consistency and prevent dirty read.

    Responsibility: data transmission module and core concurrency control algorithm

-   [Climate Change Misinformation Detection System](https://github.com/sxn2012/Climate-System) (Apr - May 2020)

    Task: Judge whether a given article is climate change misinformation by using natural language processing tools.

    Details:

    1.  Used requests to get articles from different kinds of websites, and label the article whether it is about climate change misinformation;
    2.  preprocessing the article and feed them into neural networks to train the model;
    3.  Building a 3-layer fully-connected neural networks and conducting hyper-parameter tuning, to predict whether a given article is about climate change misinformation.

    Results: The model has achieved 80% accuracy in testing dataset.

-   [Geolocation of Tweets](https://github.com/sxn2012/KT2019S2_Project2) (Oct - Nov 2019)

    Task: design a system to predict the location where a tweet is sent.

    Details:

    1.  Used requests to get tweets from Twitter and label the location;
    2.  feed the tweets to machine learning models, like knn and random forest, and make predictions.

    Results: The model has achieved 85% precision in testing dataset.

-   [Distributed Shared Whiteboard System](https://github.com/Tosnower/DS2019S2_Assignment2) (Sept - Nov 2019)

    Task: Design a distributed system so that multiple users can draw and chat simultaneously.

    Details:

    1.  Recording and broadcasting the operation of drawing board in the form of Json when a client draws a pixel, so that data consistency in distributed systems can be ensured;
    2.  Using AES to encrypt messages during transmission. When reading records from file, it will use SHA-256 to verify digest of the file.

    Results: It can reach the anticipated results and handle fewer than 50 clients of concurrency volume.

    Responsibility: Drawing board function designing, data encryption and digest verification

-   [Electronic Document Management Platform](https://github.com/sxn2012/ujs_security/tree/master/code/courses-ujs/%E6%AF%95%E4%B8%9A%E8%AE%BE%E8%AE%A1) (Feb - June 2019)

    Task: Design a platform to store and manage electronic documents, with multiversion management functions.

    Details:

    1.  The server saves all versions of different documents, and the transmission of data is implemented by using TCP protocol. FTP protocol is used for transmitting documents;

        

    2.  The messages and documents are encrypted with AES algorithm. When downloading documents, SHA-256 is used to ensure integrity of the documents;

        
    
    3.  Meanwhile, RBAC and backup and recovery skills are used to enhance the platform security.
    
    Skills: WinForm + SQL Server
    
    Results: This project has implemented a secure multiversion document management platform.
    
-   [Online Communication Software](https://github.com/sxn2012/ujs_security/tree/master/code/courses-ujs/%E8%AF%BE%E7%A8%8B%E8%AE%BE%E8%AE%A1/network%26system%20security) (May - June 2017)

    Task: Design a software that can be used to communicate between users.

    Details:

    1.  The system has used TCP communication to send messages between users;
    2.  Encryption (symmetric and asymmetric) and digital signature technologies have applied to the software to make transmission secure;

    Result: The software can be used for securely chatting between people, with the function of secret communication and group communication.
